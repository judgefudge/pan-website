<p><b>October 18, 2001 - New Release:<br>
<a name="010093" href="download.html">0.10.0.93 &quot;Little Leprechaun&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
		This is a big bugfix release: for once I'm unable to crash it in
		heavy torture testing.  Undoubtedly you'll be able to correct
		this situation. :)
		<p>
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Updates</b>
		<li>Added Preferences option to toggle custom foreground/background
		colors in the text pane vs. using the default gtk theme colors.
		Thanks to Justin Piszcz for suggesting this.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
		<li>Fixed problems with different threads manipulating articles
		concurrently.  This should fix some of the bugs recently reported
		which are irreproducable but all similar.
		<li>Articles' memory management is now tied to an article refcount
		of the group which owns them.  This resolves the Article life
		cycle issues like "what happens if a rule deletes an article that
		articlelist is drawing?" and "what if an article is expired while
		a person's reading it?" etc.
		<li>Fixes bug that caused some Tasks to get stuck in an Abort state
		even if they completed successfully.
		<li>Fixed bug that caused Tasks to sometimes not get run in the queue
		until another task was added to give it a bump.  Thanks to
		Douglas Kilpatrick for tracking down this bug. 
		<li>Fixes for creating/saving negated filter conditions.  Thanks to
		Jed S. Baer for reporting this bug.
        	<li>Fixed small but nasty memory corruption bug when saving attachments.
		<li>Fixes bug that didn't disconnect correctly from the news server
		when an error occurred while saving attachments.
		<li> Show the correct linecount in the Header Pane for multipart
		binaries when reposts are included in the multipart thread.
		<li> Fix bug that caused Pan to crash when it was started in zoom mode.
		Thanks to Leo Lipelis for reporting this bug.
		<li> Fix in GMime for Debian and Solaris charsets.  Thanks to
		Volodymyr M. Lisivka for submitting a patch to GMime.
		<li> Wrap excessively long email addresses in the header display
		so that Pan's window doesn't strech off the screen.  Thanks to
		David Watson for reporting this bug.
	</ul>


<p><b>October 6, 2001 - New Release:<br>
<a name="010092" href="download.html">0.10.0.92 &quot;Andrew Orlowski Can Kiss My Ass&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
		We're warming up to a stable release: this version has no new
		features but fixes a lot of bugs and uses less memory and disk
		space when decoding large multiparts.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Updates</b>
		<li>Uses less temporary disk space when decoding multiparts.
		This is chiefly due to some very excellent GMime code written
		by Jeffrey Stedfast.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
		<li>Fixed bug that misset the article pane's foreground color.
		Thanks to war@starband.net for reporting this bug.
		<li>Fixed bug that kept reading/deleting an article from propagating
		to its crossposts.
		<li>Fixed error with displaying mime articles with two or more text
		attachments.  Thanks to Robert Tilley for reporting this bug.
		<li>Fixed 0.10.0.91 bug where Pan confused one article as another
		during downloading.
		<li>Fixed 0.10.0.91 bug that made the progress bars get stuck
		even when a task was completed.
		<li>Fixed 0.10.0.91 bug that caused the text pane to be too large
		or to sometimes lose its scrollbars in 0.10.0.91.  This was
		in .91's new "show pictures without gtkhtml" code.
		<li>Fixed fairly large memory leak when editing preferences.
		<li>Fixed other small memory leaks.
	</ul>


<p><b>September 22, 2001 - New Release:<br>
<a name="010090" href="download.html">0.10.0.91 &quot;Hildie and Satin&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
		Charles' been busy with work lately and Christophe is on vacation,
		so 0.10.0.91 has fewer sweeping code changes than usual
		(but maybe this is a Good Thing for getting closer to a 0.10.1 release?)
		Accordingly, most changes in this release are fixes to user-reported bugs.
		It also removes the size limit for decoding Very Large attachments
		and <b>removes the gtkhtml requirement</b> for hotlinks and picture attachments!
		<p>
		A big Thank You to the users who take the time to fill out
		bug reports.  Squashing these beta bugs is important to us.
		<p>
		This release's improbable version number is to indicate that this
		is a beta between 0.10.0 and 0.10.1, without confusing RPM with
		sane, human-readable phrases like "beta". :)
	</ul>

	<ul><b>New Features</b>
		<li>gtkhtml is no longer needed for hotlinks and picture attachments.  Yay!
		<li>Added a second quote color to help distinguish
			<br><font color="blue">&gt;&gt; One reply</font>
			<br><font color="red">&gt; From another.</font>
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Updates</b>
		<li>Uses much less memory when decoding attachments.
	</ul>

	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
		<li>Fixed crash when importing an empty .newsrc file,
		including on startup.  Thanks to Derek Poon for first
		reporting this problem and submitting a fix.
		<li>Fixed crashes in the Task Manager dialog.
		<li>Fixed crashes in the progressbar when using pixmapped Gtk+ themes.
		<li>Fix problem with the queue running away with the CPU
		in 0.10.0.90.  Thanks to Chris Vance for reporting this
		bug and submitting a fix.
		<li>Fixed problem with date header not being sent when
		sending mail from Pan.  Thanks to Derek Poon for
		reporting this problem and submitting a fix.
		<li>Fix lockup from having a double-mutex thread lock
		when we can't load the user-specified font for the
		articlelist.  Thanks to Thomas K. Gamble for reporting
		this bug.
		<li>RPM and configure script build fixes.
	</ul>

<p><b>September 6, 2001 - New Release:<br><a name="010090" href="download.html">0.10.0.90 &quot;More Sugar&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
	Though this was supposed to be a minor release, we've worked
	through many requests and bug reports this time.  Per-group
	posting identities, lots of bug fixes, and GUI cleanups are the
	biggest parts of this release.
	<p>
	The improbable version number is to indicate that this is a beta
	between 0.10.0 and 0.10.1, without confusing RPM with
	sane, human-readable phrases like "beta". :)
	</ul>

	<ul><b>New Features</b>
	<li>Added Profiles manager for managing posting/mailing 
	mail, signature, etc. for different groups.
	<li>The search field above the group and article lists are now
	comboboxes that remember earlier search fields.
	Thanks to Adam Nevins for suggesting this.
	<li>Finally added support for writing posts with an external editor.
	Thanks to Sylpheed for this.
	<li>Added the ability to sort by read state (new, unread,
	number of new replies, etc) and by action state (flagged,
	queued, etc).  Thanks to David Watson and Sapient Fridge
	for suggesting this.
	<li>* Can now toggle between a normal font and a monospace font
	in the article body pane.  Thanks to KNode for this.
	<li>* Added the ability to toggle the visibility of any
	of the three main panes.
	<li>* Added an option to shorten names in the group pane; ie,
	"comp.graphics.apps.gimp" can be shortened to "c.g.a.gimp".
	</ul>

	<ul><b>Updates</b>
	<li>The "Save Article" and "Save Attachments" dialogs have been
        merged into a single dialog.
	<li>The menu has been rearranged to have more sensible feature
	groupings.
	<li>Nicer article navigation.
	<li>Small improvements in Pan's configure script.
	<li>When Following up an article, the focus in the composer window
	is set to the message box, rather than being hidden wherever the
	default was.  Thanks to Cameron Kerr for suggesting this.
	<li>Stable sorting in the thread pane added back into Pan,
	so sorting in one column, then another, effectively gives
	a two-key sort.
	</ul>

	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li>Fixed three different crashing bugs that occurred when torturing
	the article threads.
	<li>Some headers were not being saved for pending articles in
	the pan.sendlater folder.  This caused problems when trying
	to post offline.  Thanks to T'aZ, Frank Van Damme, and lots
	of other people for reporting this bug.
	<li>Fixes an i18n charset problem in 0.10.0.  Thanks to Jeffrey
	Stedfast for reporting and fixing this big.
	<li>Fixes xml decoding bug.  Thanks to Tõivo Leedjärv for reporting
	this bug and providing a patch.
	<li>Fixed annoying space reading bug that caused short articles
	to be scrolled offscreen, then back on again, before going
	to the next article.
	<li>Fix small bug that didn't let the text pane's font size to
	be changed correctly if gtkhtml was being used.  Thanks to
	David Watson for reporting this bug.
	<li>Header encoding Pan/GMime bug fixed.  Thanks to Christian
	Lohmaier for reporting this bug and Jeffrey Stedfast for
	fixing it in GMime.
	<li>pan/text.c (text_create): fix problem with changing the background
	color of the gtkhtml pane.  Thanks to Tõivo Leedjärv for providing
	this fix.
	<li>Hitting "show all headers" didn't actually show *all* headers,
	just more headers.  Thanks to Christian Lohmaier for reporting
	this bug.
	<li>In the article toolbar filter, switching between Subject and
	Author didn't cause the articles to be re-filtered.
	<li>Tab Damage errors in 0.10.0 fixed.
	<li>Small memory leaks fixed.
	</ul>

	<ul>
	The <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a> has been revised to add newer FAQs and to
        remove old ones that don't apply any more.  Also, we've added new 0.10.0
	<a href="download.html#homebrew">RPMs</a> for Red Hat.
	Thanks to John Aldrich for helping out with this.
	</ul>

<p><b>August 16, 2001 - New Release:<br><a name="0100" href="download.html">0.10.0 &quot;You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
	This has a few bugfixes, minor UI improvements, and updated translations over 0.9.90.

	<a href="#0990">0.9.90</a> announcement.
</ul>

	<ul><b>New Features</b>
	  <li>New navigation shortcuts for the Task Manager to cancel and
	  reorder tasks. Thanks to Ryan Daniels for suggesting this.

          Thanks to Huub Reuver for suggesting this.
	  <li> Show attached images even if the mime header "content-disposition"

          inline it anyway. :)

          mime messages.  Thanks to Frank van Damme for reporting this bug.

          requisition size to account for people running under lower
          resolutions.  Thanks to mdew for reporting this problem.
	  <li> The 'Edit' menu shortcut conflicted with the 'Message' window
          shortcut in 0.9.90.  Thanks to David Oberbeck for pointing out

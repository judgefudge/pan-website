<p><b>October 3, 2000 - <a name="0.8.1-beta6" href="download.html">Pan 0.8.1 Beta 6 Released!</a></b>
<br>This release has a couple of nice new features and a lot of bug fixes, particularly for posting articles.

	<p><ul><b>New Features</b>
        <li>Users can now add custom headers, such as "X-No-Archive: Yes", to a post.
	<li>The message composer now has line wrap.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Updates</b>
	<li>A few small GUI tweaks in the task manager and article display.
	<li>The Pan main window can now be resized even when tasks are running.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li>Crash when posting via "Send Now" fixed.  Thanks to Jan Schaumann
	    (among many others) for reporting this bug.
	<li>Crash in "Send Message Later" fixed.
	<li>Fixed a crash that happened when the user responeded to a selected
	    piece of text in an article.  Thanks to Jeroen Bron for reporting
	    this bug.
	<li>Delete-articles-in-current-group bug fixed. 
	<li>When posting a new message via "send now", the message is temporarily
            stored in the pan.sendlater folder.  That way if the posting fails,
            the user still has a handle to the article and can post it later.
            Thanks to Doug Palmer for suggesting this.
        <li>When the "pan.sendlater" folder's contents change, the folder is
            saved to disk immediately to ensure queued posts never get lost.
            Thanks to Garry Knight for this suggestion.
        <li>Signature delimiters not being added right bug fixed.
        <li>Pan was posting an invalid Date: header in timezones that were
            minutes, instead of hours, offset from UTC (such as +0930 instead of
            +0900 or +1000).  Thanks to Gaelyne Gasson for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fixed dumb bug that caused Pan to crash when the user tried to
            "Save As..." two files with a custom filename.  Thanks to
            J. Casalino for reporting this bug.
	</ul>

<p><b>September 15, 2000 - <a name="0.8.1-beta5" href="download.html">Pan 0.8.1 Beta 5 Released!</a></b>
<br>This is a quickie bugfix release to kill a couple of nasty bugs found in beta 4.

	<p><ul><b>Updates</b>
	<li>Slightly better memory management
	<li>Slightly smaller group data files.
	<li>Tasks that can't be ever succeed (such as trying to download an
	expired article) now abort at once, instead of waiting and retrying
	as other tasks do.  Thanks to Simon Templar for suggesting this.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li>Lockup when loading new headers for the current group fixed.
	Thanks to GF (among many, many others ;) for reporting this bug.
	<li>Watched/Ignored threads are now properly displayed (or not
	displayed, as the case may be) when new headers are fetched
	from the server.
	<li>The state for the "Show All Headers in Message Body" option is
	now saved properly between sessions.  Thanks to Jan Schaumann for
	reporting this bug.
	</ul>
	<p>

<p><b>September 11, 2000 - <a name="0.8.1-beta4" href="download.html">Pan 0.8.1 Beta 4 Released!</a></b>
	<br>This version has a nice pile of bug fixes and a completely new sort-of-Gravity-like rule system,
	which can be seen in the <a href="/screenshots/">screenshots</a> page.
	<p>
	It's great to see so many people contributing to Pan: this version's had more
	than twice the usual feedback, suggestions, patches, bug reports,
	and CVS users.  Thanks to <a href="CREDITS">everyone</a> who helped out.

	<p><ul><b>New Features</b>
        <li>A Rules tool, similar to Gravity's, has been added.
	<li>Can now Flag articles for downloading bodies in one big batch,
            similar to Agent's "Mark for Retrieval" feature.
        <li>Pan now uses the Evolution camel library to attempt to decode
            mime-encoded headers properly.
        <li>Better support for international fonts: users can choose to use
            gdk_font_load() or gdk_fontset_load() when loading fonts.
            Apparently some international fonts work better with one or the
            other.  Thanks to X-Chat IRC program for inspiring this workaround.
        <li>The ability to delete unwanted groups, saving a good chunk of memory
            by not having to load groups you'll never read.  Thanks to Jacob
            Ilsø Christensen for suggesting this.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Updates</b>
        <li>Articles threading speed doubled.
	<li>Saving attachments now looks to see if the filename already exists.
            If it does, the filename is changed slightly so that the original
            file won't be overwritten.
	<li>The Watched/Ignored state of a thread now expires after one month
            so that the threads.txt file won't keep growing forever.
        <li>"Get New Headers" is smarter about keeping any headers it got
            if the task fails in the middle of a download.
        <li>When the user selects a part of a message to reply to, and the
            signature is in the selection, the signature is no longer trimmed
            from the reply by Pan.  Thanks to Dave Hill for reporting this bug.
        <li>A default Reply-To: address can now be specified in the preferences
            dialog.  Thanks to Jan Schaumann for this patch.
        <li>The default signature file can now be specified with ~ as the home
            directory instead of requiring a fully-expanded path.  Thanks to
            Jan Schaumann for submitting this patch.
        <li>The new user wizard now asks the user for their mail server's
            address and port number (and fills in reasonable defaults).  Thanks
            to Jan Schaumann for submitting this patch.
        <li>Removed some gccisms so that Pan will build with other compilers,
            particularly Sun CC version 5.0.  Thanks to Tor Lillqvist for
            submitting this patch.
        <li>Pan now builds correctly on OpenBSD.  Thanks to Nicholas Ewing
            Seafort for the patch that made this possible.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
        <li>Fixed CPU spike/Pan lockup when downloading new headers in a group
            that's already loaded.
        <li>A crash that occurred when subthreads were deleted has been fixed.
            Thanks to Tom Dunlop for reporting this bug.
        <li>Crash in save-as dialog fixed.
        <li>Small memory leaks fixed.
        <li>In 0.8.1 beta 3 the Message-Id for new posts was being generated
            incorrectly in some circumstances, causing the news server to reject
            the post with a 441 error message  Thanks to Adam Wendt for reporting
            this bug.
        <li>The Message-Id was also sent whether or not the user preferences
            setting for Pan-generated-message-ids was on or off.
        <li>The References header was also being corrupted under certain
            circumstances.  My goodness.
        <li>"mark articles as read" and "mark thread as read" now work properly.
            Thanks to Sándor Bárány for reporting this bug.  Oh dear.
        <li>Fixed a multipart threading bug introduced in 0.8.1b3.
            Thanks to Vladimir Berezniker for this fix.
        <li>Pan now decodes all attachments in a multi-attachment post, rather
            than just the first.  Thanks to Francesco Lamonica (and many others)
            for reporting this bug.
        <li>Small .newsrc import bug fixed.  Thanks to Nicholas Ewing Seafort
            for reporting this bug.
        <li>When posting new articles, default to the currently-selected group.
            A bug in 0.8.1 beta 3 forced the user to have to type in the group
            name by hand.  Thanks to Adam Bailey for reporting this bug.
        <li>New articles are now colored in red again and are correctly
            recognized by the article filter.
        <li>"Save As" in the message composer now saves the draft of the message
            being composed, without the \n's typically found in dos text files.
            Thanks to Mark Ovens for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fixed bug that caused deleted messages to not stay deleted.
            Thanks to Paul E Johnson for reporting this bug.
        <li>The article display's code for wrapping long headers didn't handle
            long unbroken subjects (hundreds of characters with no spaces, for
            example), causing Pan to become very very wide when such a subject
            was shown.  Thanks to Tov Are Jacobsen for a patch that fixes this.
        <li>Handle unparsable user addresses in the From: line more elegantly
            when posting messages.  Thanks to Adam Bailey for reporting this bug.
        <li>Article wrapping/filling no longer wraps/fills user signatures.
        <li>"CR" characters are now stripped out when saving an article to
            a file.  Thanks to Dave Hill for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fixed a bug with the "save with user-specified filename" feature
            added in 0.8.1b3 not always saving to the right path.

<p><b>August 11, 2000 - Good Newskeeping Seal of Approval</b>
	<br>Pan's finally gone <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/Evaluations/pan-0.8.1beta3.txt">official</a>
	with its Good Newskeeping Seal!  We scored 100% on the Seal's `must'
	checklist and 93% on the `should' checklist, making Pan the
	<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/gnksa-evaluations.html">highest-scoring</a>
	Unix newsreader.


<p><b>August 8, 2000 - <a name="0.8.1-beta3" href="download.html">Pan 0.8.1 Beta 3 Released!</a></b>
<br>Whoo, it's good to get this released: there's a lot of new code here.  We should probably rename this 0.9.0 beta 1 or something.  But then again, Pan version numbers aren't <i>supposed</i> to make sense.

	<p><ul><b>New Features</b>
        <li>Agent-and-Gravity-like "zooming" of panes
        <li>Agent-and-Gravity-like keyboard navigation of articles.
        <li>No longer uses libdb for storing the data files.  Corrupted libdb
            files or incompatable versions of libdb in an RPM have been the
            most-complained-about Pan gotcha.
        <li>New articles being posted from Pan are now queued up until the
            user goes online, instead of going online automatically.
        <li>There is also a new "Send Later" feature that won't queue the
            message for sending until the user tells Pan to.  "Send Later"
	    messages can be revised before being sent.
        <li>New options to reply by email and followup to group at the same
	    time, as well as to forward a message by e-mail.
        <li>Pan now automatically adds "X-No-Productlinks: Yes" to new
            posts so that deja.com won't insert product placements into them.
        <li>User Folders are now supported for archiving messages.  Folders
            can be created, deleted, and renamed; articles can be copied and
            moved to folders.
        <li>Newsgroups can now be renamed to a user-specified alias.
        <li>More options in the "mark articles read" feature.
        <li>Now handles quoted-text transfer encoding.  Thanks to
	    Jan Schaumann for this patch.
        <li>New deja/remarq search buttons. Thanks to Jan Schaumann for
	    this patch.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Updates</b>
        <li>"Mark-All-Read" sped up again, and is now very fast.
        <li>The number of retry attempts a download task makes before
	    failing is now configurable.
        <li>The much-complained-about "Message Posted Successfully" dialog
	    has been removed.  A dialog now appears only if an error occurred
	    during sending.  Thanks to Jim Henderson for this patch.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
        <li>Pan was incorrectly handling groups with only one article.
            Thanks to Dave Hill for reporting this and submitting a patch.
        <li>The unread article count was incorrect in the cases where exactly
            one article in the group had been read.
        <li>Fix bug that could cause email being sent to be refused by the
            mail server.
        <li>Incomplete multipart articles weren't always being grouped right
            because of the article threading speedup added in 0.8.1 beta 1.
        <li>0.8.1 beta 2's "Faster saving of downloaded headers" is still
	    there, but the implementation had a bug that kept old headers
	    from being loaded when downloading new headers for Pan's
	    current group.
        <li>If a user was both posting and mailing an article, and one but
	    not both actions failed, the next attempt would still do both
	    actions, resulting in the same message posted or mailed multiple
	    times.
        <li>Fixed problem with newsgroup messages being posted with the wrong
            time due to timezone offset problems.  Thanks to Michael for
            reporting this bug.
        <li>Dates were sometimes being shown incorrectly (such as off by one
	    hour) in the article headers window and in the threaded article
	    list.
	</ul>


	<p><b>July 12, 2000 - <a name="napster">Napster Buyout Talks</a></b>
	<p><ul><b>Nothing has been signed yet</b>, but as we're drowning in
	e-mail asking us about it, I've gotten permission to put up this mini-FAQ:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Yes, Napster has approached us in buyout talks.
	<li>Yes, Napster sees the <a href="oldnews-08.html#riaa">RIAA/Pan suit</a> as a legal asset.  We can't say any more about this.
	<li>Yes, Napster's legal team--including David Boies--would work with us on our RIAA suit.
	<li>Yes, Pan will keep its <a href="http://www.debian.org/intro/free">GPL</a> license.
	</ul>
	<p>
	The talks will happen in their own sweet time, so please stop
	asking us about this.
	</ul>


<p><b>July 12, 2000 - <a name="0.8.1-beta2" href="download.html">Pan 0.8.1 Beta 2 Released!</a></b>
<br>This is a bugfix release with some speedups and better database handling thrown in.

	<p><ul><b>Updated</b>
        <li>Faster saving of downloaded headers: Pan no longer needs to
	    load locally cached headers for merging with new headers.
        <li>We now quote the user's real name, if present, in the From: line.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li>Bug in "File" menu disabling the 'exit' feature Fixed.  Thanks to
	    Mike Rylander for reporting this bug.
	<li>free-memory-read crash when deleting large groups of articles+replies
	    bug fixed.  Thanks to Purify for reporting this bug.
        <li>Infinite loop in importing .newsrc files fixed.  Thanks to
	    Todd Larason for reporting this bug and contributing a patch.
        <li>Fixed threading bug that sometimes cause Pan to crash when
            popping up the Save-Attachment-As: dialog.
        <li>fixed bug that could thread multipart articles incorrectly in rare
            circumstances.  Thanks to Sándor Bárány for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fixed "Must Have One Address in From: line" error during posting
            that sometimes appeared even if there _was_ exactly one address.
            Thanks to Bas Mevissen for reporting this bug.
        <li>Commas inside quoted text in the From: and To: headers of a
            message/letter being posted/mailed are now handled properly.
            Thanks to Adam Bailey for reporting this bug.
        <li>Don't pop up the `pan changed database formats!' the second time
            that a new user runs Pan.
	</ul>

	<p><b>June 27, 2000 - <a name="unbundle2">Mailing List Update</a></b>
	<p><ul>The pan-users mailing list is up and running again.
	Last week's HP crash has killed the subscriber list, though.
	If you were on the list before, you'll need to
	<a href="contact.html#mailinglist">resubscribe</a>.
	</ul>

	<p><b>June 26, 2000 - <a name="unbundle2">RIAA Lawsuit Update</a></b>
	<p><ul>The RIAA has returned to its original demand that we remove the
	binary decoder from Pan.  They believe that since the decoder is a
	<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~fp/uudeview/">
	third-party library</a>, our <a href="#unbundle">claim</a> that it's
	unremovable is false.  So with our July 24 court date a little less
	than a month away, we're back to square one.
	<p>
	The strangest moment of the week came when one RIAA lawyer,
	in a moment of frustration, asked us how we'd feel if someone took
	Pan and gave it away to millions of users for free.  After the
	Pan team stopped laughing, the Andover lawyers had to explain why
	we liked the idea so much.  There's
	a Salon article here somewhere. :)
	</ul>

<p><b>June 26, 2000 - <a name="0.8.1-beta1" href="download.html">Pan 0.8.1 Beta 1 Released!</a></b>

	<p><ul><b>New Features</b>
	<li>Importing and Exporting of .newsrc files now supported.
	<li>Users can now 'catch up' with groups a la Forte Agent
	<li>Users can now update the article/new article counts without downloading article headers.
	<li>Users can now download an arbitrary number of article headers from a group.
            Previously, is was one of All, New, or a sample of 150.
	<li>Added "Organization" Header to messages being posted.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Updated</b>
        <li>Much faster marking of articles as read or unread.
        <li>Articles and group changes are now cached for being written to the
            database, rather than written each time there's a change.  This
	    makes Pan more responsive and lessens database traffic.
        <li>Article threading sped up by about 25%.
	<li>The Task Manager user interface now eats less cycles.  This is
	    especially helpful for huge task lists, as the interface would get
	    slower as the list grew longer.
	<li>The "Save Attachment As" dialog now lets you choose to add the save
	    task either to the front or the back of the Task queue
	<li>Deleting articles is slightly faster.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
        <li>CPU runaway due to corrupted database files bug fixed.
	<li>Pan now handles reconnecting to the server better after a dropped
	    ppp connection has been re-established.
        <li>Small memory leaks fixed; other memory use reduced.
        <li>Multiple selections in the article list handled more gracefully.
            This fixes a gui lockup bug.  Thanks to Kimmo Karlsson for reporting
            this.
        <li>Better sanity checking of email address in the "From" and "Mail To"
            headers in the compose window.  Previously Pan thought addresses like
            "Charles &lt;@org&gt;" were syntactically valid.
        <li>Better sanity checking &amp; warnings when the user tries to post empty
            messages.  Previous versions of Pan thought the attribution line
            "In article &lt;sf@sd&gt;, Joe wrote:" was new content and therefore didn't
            issue a warning for empty followups.
        <li>The References: header wasn't keeping as many headers as could fit
	    in 998 characters as recommended by the Good Newskeeping Seal of
	    Approval.
	<li>Signature files that contain the signature delimiter line ("-- ")
	    were having the signature delimiter line added by pan anyway,
	    resulting in two signature delimiters.
        <li>"User-Agent" is now used instead of "X-Newsreader" in the headers of
            articles posted with Pan.  Thanks to Adam Bailey for reporting this.
	</ul>

	There is still no court date yet for RIAA vs. SuperPimpSoft.  Andover's

	those days: we've just been mailed a <b>large</b> patch that adds
	<a href="http://www.themes.org/">themes</a> to Pan.
	<p>
	Themes have been one of the most asked-for features in Pan, so many
	of you already understand how welcome this is.  The rest of you may
	perk up in interest when you learn that this patch was done by none
	other than the godfathers of Linux theming: Propaganda's Bowie J. Poag
	and Enlightenment's <a href="http://www.rasterman.com/">Rasterman</a>!
	<p>
	We're not ready to release this yet because we're working out some
	memory leak issues with the patch.  So to whet your appetite,
	<a href="pan-themes.html">here's a screenshot</a> of the default
	theme that will ship with the next version of Pan.
	</ul>

	<p><b>May 17, 2000 - <a name="0.8.0" href="download.html">Pan 0.8.0 Released</a></b>
	<p>
	<font color="red">The article cache file format changed in 0.8.0 beta 7.
	If upgrading from 0.8.0 beta 6 or older, remove ~/.pan/data/yourserver/*.db
	before running this version.</font>
	<p>
	After eight beta releases, this is the first stable release of Pan in
	three months.  An incomplete list of changes since Pan 0.7.6:

	<p><ul><b>New Features</b>
	<li>New Task Manager to let users re-prioritize the order in which
	queued tasks should be executed, remove tasks from the queue,
	abort running tasks, and re-queue failed tasks.
	<li>Online/Offline newsreading is now supported.
	<li>Supports wrapping and filling articles to a user-specified column
	width, both in the article reader and article composer.
	<li>Ability to specify on the fly where attachments should be saved
	(select a group of articles and save to incoming/mp3/artist/title/)
	<li>If there is more than one post for a part of a multipart message
	(such as from a repost), Pan now prompts the user to select which
	posts to use when decoding the message.  This is an optional
	dialog; by default, Pan will try to figure out which posts to use
	on its own.
	<li>Much better use of system resources, particularly memory.
	<li>Much faster decoding of binary attachments.
	<li>Added the ability to delete, download, mark read, and mark unread
	specific subthreads of articles.  Previously you could act upon
	one article or the entire thread.
	<li>Ability to "Delete decoded attachment", to remove a decoded
	file from your $download_dir while inside of Pan.
	<li>Better keyboard navigation: now there are menu items and keyboard
	shortcuts for moving to an article's replies, or to up to the article
	which the current article is a reply to.
	<li>Added "New Articles" to the Article Filter Toolbar
	<li>New "Online Settings" preferences dialog
	<li>User can now specify how Pan goes online: as needed without
	asking, only after asking the user, or to quietly stay offline
	until told otherwise.
	<li>Added ability to color the foreground, background and quoted
	content colors in the article display window.
	<li>Tracking of task failures, and automatic retries, added.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Updated</b>
	<li>Updated Danish Finnish, French, German, Italian, Korean,
	Norwegian, Polish, Russian, and Spanish translations.
	<li>Decode, Decode As, and Open attachment operations won't
	re-download articles if they were already successfully saved
	as files. 
	<li>"Sample Articles from Group" now samples from the most recent
	messages, rather than the oldest messages.  Thanks to
	Tov are Jacobsen for suggesting this.
	<li>Time to clear out local cache (such as on shutdown) is much faster.
	<li>The "From:" line in new posts is now formated "User" <mail@foo.com>
	instead of just mail@foo.com
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li>Crashing bug when user tried to delete a handful of articles,
	especially a mix of threads and single-posts, fixed.
	Thanks to Marvin Pierce for reporting this bug.
	<li>Fixed bug that crashed pan when a there was no route to the
	news server.  Strangely this bug has been around for ages but has
	never been reported before now.  Thanks to Craig Orsinger
	<orsingerc@epg-gw1.lewis.army.mil> for reporting this bug.
	<li>The timezone offset in the Date: header for user-posted messages
	was being calculated incorrectly for people on the + side of GMT.
	Thanks to Philip Johnson for reporting this bug.
	<li>Incorrect parsing of Date: headers with "00" as shorthand for the
	year 2000 fixed.  Thanks to Jeff Shepherd for reporting this bug.
	<li>Some news servers would respond to POST commands with a
	"441 document contains no body, only headers".  Thanks to
	David K. Watson for reporting this bug.
	<li>In the same vein, Pan was only sending linefeeds instead of
	carriage return + linefeed in the body of articles being posted.
	D'oh!  Thanks to John B. Moreno for reporting this bug.
	<li>If a Pan session ended in the middle of a multipart-attachment
	download-before-decode, Pan didn't complete the missing part of
	the file before decoding.
	<li>Fixed memory corruption bug when user saved the Log Viewer's
	contents to a file.
	<li>Fixed problem with getting new groups from Typhoon news servers.
	Thanks to Alex V Flinsch <avflinsch@att.net> for reporting this bug.
	<li>Fixed problem where the "get new groups from Server" command was
	always asking for new groups since January 1 1970, rather than
	the actual last time we asked for groups.  Thanks to Alex V Flinsch
	for reporting this bug.
	<li>Decode crash bug fixed.
	<li>Hang-after-getting-grouplist fixed.  Thanks to Mike Brodbelt
	for reporting this bug.
	<li>Pan was only decoding the first binary attachment to an article
	rather than all of them.  Thanks to Manuel Lucena Lopez
	for reporting this bug.
	<li>Save Attachment was not working for some single part posts.
	<li>Many, many, many memory leaks fixed.
	<li>"NEWGROUP" NNTP command now drops back to two-digit years if a
	four-digit-year formatted message fails.  Thanks to Paul McGarry
	for tracking down this bug.
	<li>Backwards compatability for servers that don't support the "mode
	reader" nntp extension.  Thanks to Magnus Holmberg for reporting this
	bug.
	<li>Too-long-headers now handled more gracefully in the headers display.
	Thanks to Bruce Richardson for reporting this bug.
	<li>The preferences dialog sometimes crashed or didn't save the changes,
	particularly news server preferences.
	<li>Pan 0.7.6 crashed when a corrupt article header was read.
	<li>The "References:" message header in 0.7.6 was misformatted.

        <p><b><a name="unbundle">May 17, 2000 - RIAA Demands Decoder be Removed from Pan</a></b>
	<ul>
	As <a href="#riaa_negotiate">reported</a> on this page, SuperPimpSoft has been in
	negotiations with the <a href="oldnews-08.html#riaa">RIAA</a> to settle their lawsuit out of court. 
	The RIAA's complaint is that Pan's article attachment decoder
	could be used to decode copyrighted
	<a href="http://modernhumorist.com/mh/0004/propaganda/mp3.jpg">mp3</a>.
	<p>
	These negotiations have fallen through.  The RIAA's final offer is
	that they will drop the suit only if we unbundle Pan's attachment
	decoder from the newsreader.  SuperPimpSoft is unwilling to do this:
	the attachment decoder is seamlessly integrated into Pan and cannot
	be removed.
	<p>
	It's in defense of the right to innovate on behalf of consumers that
	SuperPimpSoft has made the painful decision to endure a lawsuit.
 We simply don't think the RIAA should be involved in product design.
	<p>
	Our decision to stand by our principles would not have been
	financially possible without the help of
	<a href="http://andover.net/">Andover</a>,
	which has generously pledged the support of their lawyers.
	(These are the same lawyers working with Slashdot on the
	<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/05/11/0153247&mode=thread">Slashdot/MS/Kerberos</a> imbroglio.) <b>Thank You!</b> 
	<p>
	We'll post court dates as soon as we have them.  See you in court!
	</ul>

	<p><b><a name="riaa_negotiate">May 9, 2000 - SuperPimpSoft / RIAA Update</a></b>
	<ul>
	After our cancelled IPO, and last month's weak
	<a href="oldnews-08.html#funding">round of financing</a>,
	SuperPimpSoft has decided that it does not have the finances
	necessary to fight the <a href="oldnews-08.html#riaa">RIAA</a> in court.
	The <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>
	has also turned down our requests for legal aid, claiming that
	it would be a "PR Disaster to back SuperPimps".
	<p>
	We are currently in negotiations with the RIAA to see if this
	matter can be settled out-of-court.  Updates will be posted
	here on the Pan home page.

	<p>Lawyers representing the heavy metal band
	<a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/04/14/www.metallica.com/">Metallica</a> are said to be preparing their own

<p><b>June 7, 2001 - <a name="097" href="download.html">0.9.7 &quot;Just Another Victim of the Ambient Morality&quot;</a> Released!</b>
	<ul>
	Pan 0.9.7 has a faster startup time, smaller memory footprint,
	more accurate decoding of binary attachments, better handling of
	corrupt headers and .newsrc files, some usability and speed
	improvements, and about 30 bugfixes.
	<p>
	This is is the first stable release in two months, so the full
	list of improvements is fairly long.  However 0.9.7's also been
	battle-tested by users through five prereleases, so hopefully all
	these changes won't yield new bugs.
	<p>
	0.9.7 also represents a large effort to clean up Pan's internals
	for easier maintainence and automated regression testing.
	</ul>

	<ul><b>New Features</b>
	<li> filter-by-author to the thread toolbar.
	<li> When deleting or marking read a crossposted article, the
	action operates on all the crossposted copies of the article.
	Thanks to Bob Broughton for requesting this feature.
	<li> Added the ability to pause the task manager's queue.  Thanks to
	Phillip Pi, Ron Youvan, Ryan Daniels, and others for requesting
	this feature.
	<li> Added the option to automatically import a .newsrc file on
	startup and export it on shutdown.
	<li> Added menu buttons for removing cached article bodies for
	selected articles, threads, or an entire group.  Thanks to
	Budman for suggesting this feature.
	</ul>

	<ul><b>Updates</b>
	<li>Now loads unsubscribed groups only when the "all" group tab is
        clicked instead of automatically on startup.  This lets Pan start
        faster and use less memory.
	<li>Now requires much less memory to decode attachments.  Thanks to
        Wendell Dingus, Aluminum Foil Ball, and many others for suggesting
        this.
        <li> Changed the local article cache to make it likelier that a
        failed multipart decode will keep the parts it successfully
        downloaded for a retry.  Thanks to Frederik Vanrenterghem and
        Aluminum Foil Ball for suggesting this change.
        <li> Duplicate filenames during saving attachments are now renamed
        foo_2.gif, foo_3.gif, etc. instead of foo.2.gif, foo.3.gif, for
        beter sorting.  Thanks to Ron Youvan for suggesting this change.
        <li> Better handling of thread tracking even when an article in the
        thread has a corrupt References: header.  Thank to Jim Henderson
        for reporting this problem and Adrian von Bidder for suggesting a
        solution.
        <li> More consistent checking for corrupt article headers from the news
        server.  Sideways thanks to usenetserver.com for providing corrupt
        headers repeatably so that I could track this down.
        <li> Better recovery when importing of missing, corrupt, or
        completely broken .newsrc files.
        <li> Text in an alt.binaries.pictures article is now displayed before
        the pictures, rather than after them, by request from Margus Ramst
        and Frank Van Damme.
        <li> Now handles FIFO .signature files.  Thanks to Daniel Burrows for
        suggesting this feature.
        <li> Updated some icons.  Thanks to Paolo Bacchilega for suggesting
        these changes and providing icons.
	</ul>

	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
        <li> Fixed bug that caused Pan to crash while decoding some articles.
        <li> Fixed crash in the "reply with external mailer" utility.  Thanks
        to Mohit Agarwal and Gareth for reporting this bug.
        <li> Fixed bug that caused Pan to crash sometime when posting or when
        loading the pan.sent folder.   Thanks to Pete at gmx.net and
        Wolfgang Schricker for reporting this bug.
        <li> Fixed bug that caused Pan to crash when the user tried to send
        mail without having a mail server defined.  Thanks to Cory Hill
        for reporting this bug.
        <li> Now correctly decodes uuencoded multipart posts that have non-uu
        text (such as checksums or ads added by newsservers) at the end
        of each post.  Thanks to Ken Geis, Gauze, Aluminum Foil Ball, 
        Kim Robinson, and everyone else who reported this.
        <li> Handle multiple UU-encoded attachments correctly.  Thanks to
        Huub Reuver for reporting this.
        <li> Quoted and original text are now colorized correctly in
        HTML mode.
        <li> Now sends "MODE READER" upon connection to make some INN news
        servers happier.  Thanks to Achim Settelmeier for reporting
        this bug.
        <li> Fixed focus bug in thread view when toggling between zoomed
        panes.  Thanks to Julien Plissonneau Duquene for reporting this
        bug and supplying a patch.
        <li>Resumed mulitpart downloads didn't show their progresses
        correctly in the progress bar in the bottom of the main window.
        Thanks to Adam Huffman and Sandor Barany for reporting this bug.
        <li>The "open attachments" command now works properly even when there
        is more than one attachment in the file.
        <li>Moving back to the zoomed thread view from the zoomed article
        view no longer moves the thread view down to the bottom of the
        list.  Thanks <i>very</i> much to Samuel Solon for providing a
        workaround to this gtk+ bug.
        <li>Fixed problem with the list panes looking wrong under dark gtk
        themes.  Lots of people reported this bug, but special thanks
        go to Duane Healing and Jed Baer for helping track this one down.
        <li>Attachements with filenames containing apostrophes are now
        correctly saved.  Thanks to Ron Youvan for reporting this bug.
        <li>Selecting all tasks in the task manager and hitting 'move task
        down' repeatedly would cause Pan to go into a loop until the
        task manager window was closed.  Thanks to Yannick Pollart for
        reporting this bug.
	<li>Is anyone still reading this?
        <li>Save-Article-Text will now download the article's body if it
        hasn't been downloaded already.  Thanks to Jacob Christensen
        for reporting this bug.
        <li>Better handling of encoded email addresses.  Thanks to
        hristian Lohmaier for reporting a couple of encoding-related
        bugs.
        <li>Fixed RH problems with the RPM spec files.  Thanks to
        Yosi Markovich for reporting this bug.
        <li>Move and Copy articles to a folder acted the same, but Move
        should have removed the articles from the original group.
        Thanks to Wolfgang Schricker for reporting this bug.
        <li>Small memory leaks and other small bugs fixed.

	</ul>
	

<p><b>May 24, 2001 - <a name="097pre5" href="download.html">0.9.7pre5 &quot;Neddie Seagoon&quot;</a></b>

	<ul>
	This is intended to be the last prerelease before 0.9.7, which in
	turn will be the last big release in the 0.9 series.  We're sick to
	death of bugfixes and are itching to crank out some _new_ code for
	0.10.0. :)
	<p>
	If your favorite bug still isn't fixed in this release, then
	it's probably been lost behind the sofa and you should report it
	anew at <a href="mailto:pan@rebelbase.com">pan@rebelbase.com</a>.  Thanks.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>New Features</b>
	<li>Added the ability to pause the task manager's queue.  Thanks to
            Phillip Pi, Ron Youvan, Ryan Daniels, and others for requesting
	    this feature.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li> Fixed crash that occurred when activating the "open in new window"
	feature from the text window's popup menu.  Thanks to John LeMay,
	Ron Youvan, and Margus Ramst for reporting this bug.
	<li> Fixed problem with the list panes looking wrong under dark gtk
	themes.  Lots of people reported this bug, but special thanks
	go to Duane Healing and Jed Baer for helping track this one down.
	<li> Fixed problem that caused articles to be incorrectly marked unread.
	Thanks to Christophe Lambin for first reporting this bug.
	<li> Fixed bug that broke the wrapping/filling code when replying to
	a message.  Thanks to Dietmar Staab for reporting this bug.
	<li> Move and Copy articles to a folder acted the same, but Move should
	have removed the articles from the original group.  Thanks to
	Wolfgang Schricker for reporting this bug.
	<li> Fixed RH problems with the RPM spec files.  Thanks to
	Yosi Markovich for reporting this bug.
	<li> Small memory leaks fixed.

<p><b>May 17, 2001 - <a name="097pre4" href="download.html">0.9.7pre4 &quot;Twelve Misty Mountains&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
	In addition to the usual round of bugfixes, this release works on
	unavoidable errors: importing corrupt .newsrc files, downloading corrupt
	headers from the news server, and broken threads are all handled a little
	better now.
	<p>
	If your favorite bug isn't fixed in this release, then I've forgotten it and you
	should re-submit it.  Thanks.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Updates</b>

	</ul>
	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
		<li>One more attempt to get very large articles to decode properly even
		the user's cache is set to some small size.  Thanks to the flood of
		people reporting this problem against pre2 and pre3.
		<li>Fix bug that caused folders to be corrupted or erased in earlier
		prereleases when the "save setup" button was pressed.
		<li>Moving back to the zoomed thread view from the zoomed article view
		no longer moves the thread view down to the bottom of the list.
		Thanks *very* much to Samuel Solon for providing a workaround to
		this gtk+ bug.

<p><b>May 4, 2001 - <a name="097pre1" href="download.html">Pan 0.9.7-pre1 &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
	This release has big wins for people decoding binaries, a
	smaller memory footprint, adds auto import/export of .newsrc
	files, and has a lot of little bugfixes.
	<p>
	Additionally, a lot of Pan's infrastructure has been rewritten
	to make unit testing feasable.  The unit tests are looking good,
	and feedback from CVS users is positive, but since the diffs from
	0.9.6 are larger than usual I'm hedging my bets with a prerelease
	cycle.
	<p>
	0.9.7 should also have more up-to-date translations than this
	pre-release.
	</ul>

	<p>
	<ul><b>New Features</b>
        <li>Added filtering by author to the thread view toolbar.
        <li>Added optional automatic support to import .newsrc files on
            startup and export them on shutdown.
        <li>Added menu options for purging downloaded message bodies for

<p><b>Mar 26, 2001 - <a name="096" href="download.html">Pan 0.9.6 &quot;Snufkin's Flag&quot;</a></b>
	<ul>
        Once again your friendly neighborhood Pan development team has slaved
	night and day tracking down problems to make Pan newsreading a
	bug-free experience.  A few small usability tweaks also slipped into
	this release.
	<p>
	If all goes well this version of Pan will be included in Gnome 1.4's
	&quot;Fifth Toe&quot; set of applications.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>New Features</b>
	<li>Shift-Delete is now a shortcut to delete all selected articles
            and replies.
        <li>Now if a user has &gt;1 group selected in the grouplist when they
            try to post a new message, all the groups are added, for
            crossposting, to Newsgroups: entry field in the message composer.
            Thanks to Adam Warner for suggesting this.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>Updates</b>
	<li>The task manager, log viewer, and message composer windows all
            now remember their sizes each time they're opened.  Thanks to
            Garry Knight for suggesting this.
        <li>Pan now lets users choose to reserve a server connection for
            downloading messages to read.  That way you can keep reading
            comfortably even while new headers or binary attachments are
            being downloaded.  Thanks to Eric Ortega for this suggestion.
        <li>The &quot;update article counts&quot; task is more fault-tolerant
            now.  Thanks to Sven Neuhaus for suggesting this.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li>Fixed bug that caused Pan to crash when user edited the fonts or
            some other items in the preferences dialog for the first time.
            Thanks to Adam Huffman and John LeMay Jr. for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fix bug that could corrupt the article header cache files
            when they were being saved.
        <li>Raised gtkhtml requirement to 0.8.3 for the inline images version
            of Pan.  This fixes some i18n font issues and some image rendering
            problems seen in Pan under gtkhtml 0.8.2.
        <li>Fix lockup bug that occurred when the user hit the thread filter
            buttons repeatedly while loading a group.  Thanks to Sven Neuhaus
            for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fixed bug that caused Pan to crash when certain multipart binaries
            were deleted from Pan in the thread view.  Thanks to Adam Huffman
            for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fix bug that crashed Pan when the user started a task to download
            a group of articles, and then deleted some of the articles while
            the task was running.
        <li>Fixed Pan crash that occurred when decoding a multipart article
            where one of the articles in the group had no body, just headers.
            Thanks to Gauze for reporting ghis bug.
        <li>Fixed error that prevented servers from being saved properly for
            new users in some circumstances.
        <li>Fixed error that corrupted memory and tallies of which
            articles were read and which were unread.
        <li>Small memory leak fixed.
        <li>Fixed rate gtk+-1.2.9 build bug.  Thanks to Christophe Lambin
            for reporting this bug.
        <li>The message composition window was not resizable under some window
            managers, such as BlackBox.  Thanks to Christophe Lambin,

        <li>Fixed bug that let invalid From: addresses slip by in 0.9.5 posts.
        <li>Fixed bug that kept grouplist menu buttons enabled even when no

            be shown sometimes during space reading.

<p><b>Mar 12, 2001 - <a name="095" href="download.html">Pan 0.9.5 &quot;Will quality software be written for the hobby market?&quot; Released!</a></b>
	<ul>
	For once we've controlled our feature-adding desires long enough
	to get out a bugfix release.  0.9.5 fixes about two dozen bugs,
	large and small.  That's not sexy, I know, but what the heck. :)
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>Updates</b>
	<li>Pan is now more tolerant of headers that are missing subjects,
            dates, and so forth.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
        <li>No longer crashes if the header cache is corrupted.  Instead it
            skip the corrupted headers and logs an error to let the user know
            what happened.
        <li>Fix in parsing the 'begin' line of uuencoded attachments: file
            permissions preceeded by a '0' (to denote an octal number) are now
            handled.  Thanks to Brian Keefer for reporting this bug.
        <li>Accepts articles whose Date: header has no seconds.  Some broken
            software posts articles this way.  Thanks to Dave Hill for reporting
            this problem and submitting a patch.
        <li>The Group menu wouldn't appear unless a group was selected.  Thanks
            to Craig Maloney, Lance Simmons, and others for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fixed thread bug that corupted memory when two threads purged the
            article cache at the same time.
        <li>Fixed bug that occurred when thread A modified the article filter
            that was being used in thread B to populate the article tree.
        <li>Fix memory corruption bug that occurred when switching groups while
            an download task was still queued for the first group.
        <li>Fix memory corruption bug that occurred when the user deleted
            articles that in the queue for downloading or decoding.
        <li>Flushing the "pan.sendlater" folder didn't move the articles
            out of the folder after posting, causing them to possibly be
            reposted accidentally.  Thanks to Garry Knight fore reporting this
            bug.
        <li>Fix bug in counting read/unread article totals.
        <li>Changing the filter settings in the article toolbar caused the
            articles to be unsorted as a side-effect.  Thanks to Sandor Barany
            for reporting this bug and Himanshu J. Gohel for suggesting a fix.
        <li>New articles were being displayed with a 'new' icon instead of a
            'read' icon even if they had been read.  Thanks to German Gomez
            Garcia for reporting this bug.
        <li>Fixed bug that crashed Pan when decoding an article with a '%' in
            its subject.  Thanks to rschu for reporting this bug.
        <li>Pan now handles port numbers greater than 32768.  Thanks to Keith
            Miller for reporting this bug.
        <li>Selecting text "backwards" (back to front) and pressing 'reply'
            now works.  Thanks to A A Arendsen for reporting this bug.
        <li>When changing news servers, the titlebar is now updated to show
            the new server's name.  Thanks to Garry Knight for reporting this
            bug.

<p><b>Feb 26, 2001 - <a name="094" href="download.html">Pan 0.9.4 &quot;I would have kissed his boo-boo but then I remembered he was a BAD MONKEY so I kicked his face!&quot; Released!</a></b>
	<ul>
	This is release is primarily a bugfix release but has a handful of user interface

	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>New Features</b>
        <li>New icons to show which article bodies are cached locally for better offline reading.
	<li>Added clickable URLs to the gtkhtml version of Pan.  URLs will be
            opened with the appropriate application specified in your mime setup.
        <li>Added user-configurable date format strings for how dates should be
            displayed in the thread and article views.
        <li>Added option to 'break' a thread when the subject line changes.
            This is to group separately a subthread that spins off on a
            different topic.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>Updates</b>
        <li>The log window has been rewritten and provides more useful
            information now.  Moreover errors are now flagged with an error
            icon, and an error icon appears in the main window's toolbar to
            let users know when errors are occurring.
        <li>The local article cache is smarter about knowing when to clear out
            old messages, and making sure that the oldest messages get purged
            first.
        <li>Faster loading mark saving of articles, deleting of articles,
            marking articles read/unread, and so on.
        <li>Text wrapping in the display is now turned off by default for
            new users.
        <li>Pan now accepts messages with unparseable From: headers instead
            of discarding to them.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
        <li>Fixed a serious memory corruption bug that was introduced in 0.9.3.
        <li>Fixed crash that occurred when deleting articles and then reading
            more articles.  Thanks to John LeMay for reporting this bug.
        <li>Try to authenticate as soon as we connect to the NNTP server,
            so that members-only groups will be displayed.  Thanks to
            Sébastien Delestaing and others for reporting this problem.
        <li>Runs properly with gtkhtml whether it's configured with GConf
            or not.  Thanks to Thomas Zajic and Joseph Wang for both supplying
            patches for this.
        <li>Setting the font for the HTML window didn't work under some
            international fonts in 0.9.3.
        <li>Fixed bug that kept some articles from being saved to disk.
            This was also a 0.9.3 bug.   Guess that's what we get for going
            two months between 0.9.2 and 0.9.3, eh.
        <li>Pieces were dropping out of the middle of decoded multipart posts
            if the server dropped connection in the middle of downloading an
            article.  Thanks to Ronny Haryanto for reporting this bug and
            correctly sussing out the problem, and to Genadz Batsyan
            for supplying a patch.
        <li>Make sure Pan correctly handles those darn 'cut here' messages
            even in multipart uuencoded posts.  Thanks to Sándor Bárány for
            reporting this bug.
        <li>Don't substitute spaces with underscores when saving attachments.
            Thanks to Jed S. Baer and Aluminum Foil Ball for suggesting this.
        <li>Added a patch from James Amundson that keeps the text window
            from growing too large when there is a long header being displayed.
        <li>The Pan main window layouts were not being saved properly between
            sessions when the user changed the placement of the windows.
        <li>Fixed memory corruption problem that occurred when 'download
            all bodies' was selected from the thread view.
        <li>Fails more gracefully when the server refuses connection with a
            &quot;400 - Server connection limit reached&quot; error message.  Thanks to
            Frank Eisfeld for reporting this bug.
        <li>Now handles smtp servers that send out multiline 200 handshake
            messages.  Thanks to Adrian Miranda for reporting this bug.

	Today, the new Pan Project changed its name to ChimPanXi.  The name
	ChimPanXi (which is actually pronounced chim-"pan-'zE) differs from
	our old name in that we can actually trademark it and thereby ward off
	the legions of copycats who want to ride on our coattails,
	such as the Java Pan clone "JaPan".
	<p>
	Napster, which owns Pan's <a href="http://www.superpimp.org/">old domain</a>,
	has kindly agreed to redirect to our new-and-improved,
	politically correct, and owned-by-us domain,
	<a href="http://pan.rebelbase.com/">pan.rebelbase.com</a>.
	<i>Thank You!</i>
	<p>
	Everything else about us remains unchanged.

	After October's <a href="oldnews-09.html#riaawins">legal loss</a> over its mp3
	decoder and parent company Napster's
	<a href="http://www.napster.com/pressroom/001031b.html">efforts</a> to make peace with

	has ended development on Pan.
	<p>
	RIAA President Hillary Rosen and Napster CEO Hank Barry
	spoke in a phone news conference on Monday morning.
	"We believe that this is another step towards having the
	music industry work with us rather than against us,"
	said Barry.  Rosen said little during the conference, but her
	presence was telling: The RIAA/Pan lawsuit is currently
	in its damages phase, and Pan's fate may shave some of those
	damages from Napster's legal bills.
	<p>
	The Pan development team is currently in limbo.  A lot of suits
	are meeting right now to decide what to do with us.  I've heard
	two rumors: one, that we're going to be tasked to do an official
	version of Napster for KDE, and two, that we may be sold again,

<p><b>October 11, 2000 - <a name="riaawins">RIAA Wins Pan Lawsuit</a></b>

	<a href="http://www.riaa.org">RIAA</a> and 
	<a href="index.html">SuperPimpSoft</a>
	has come to an unforunate end.  Mere hours after today's release of
	<a href="download.html">Pan 0.9</a>,
	United States District Judge Mark Taylor ruled against the
	free-software startup.  In a strongly-worded 89-page
	ruling the Judge declared that
	SuperPimpSoft had wrongly encouraged copyright violation
	of pictures, music, and even movies by providing the ability
	to decode and save files posted to Usenet.  Court is in recess
	until Friday, when it will convene to discuss injunctive and
	declaratory relief.
	<p>
	Hillary Rosen, president of the RIAA, was ebullient: ``As with
	[the lawsuit against] mp3.com, the courts have sided with the
	music makers -- the dreamers of dreams -- instead of high-tech
	vultures."
	<p>
	The ruling must come an embarassing blow to Napster, which
	<a href="oldnews-09.html#napster2">purchased</a> the free-software startup
	one week ago.  Neither Napster nor SuperPimpSoft had any
	comment at press time.
	<p>
	One Pan programmer, who refused to be named, hinted that today's
	release of 0.9 was no accident:  "[Judge] Taylor's been hostile to
	us since day one.  We wanted to release one final version with
	the [mp3] decoder.''

	stable version in almost five months.  The list of changes is
	about as thick as a Robert Jordan novel, so go grab a cup of
	coffee while your T3 line finishes downloading it...
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul><b>New Features</b>
	<li>Pan now automatically adds "X-No-Productlinks: Yes" to new
	posts so that deja.com won't insert product placements into them.
	<li>Importing and Exporting of .newsrc files now supported.
	<li>A Rules tool, similar to Gravity's, has been added.
	<li>New articles being posted from Pan are now queued up until the
	user goes online, instead of going online automatically.
	<li>Agent-and-Gravity-like keyboard navigation of articles.
	<li>Agent-and-Gravity-like "zooming" of panes
	<li>Added "mute quoted text" option.
	<li>Users can now add custom headers, such as "X-No-Archive: Yes", to a post.
	<li>The message composer now has line wrap.
	<li>User Folders are now supported for archiving messages.  Folders
	can be created, deleted, and renamed; articles can be copied and
	moved to folders.
	<li>There is also a new "Send Later" feature that won't queue the
	message for sending until the user tells Pan to.  Queued and
	"Send Later" messages can be revised before being sent.
	<li>One can now download an arbitrary number of article headers from a
	group.  Previously, is was one of All, New, or a sample of 150.
	<li>No longer uses libdb for storing the data files.  Corrupted libdb
	files or incompatable versions of libdb in an RPM have been the
	most-complained-about Pan gotcha.
	<li>Can now Flag articles for downloading bodies in one big batch,
	similar to Agent's "Mark for Retrieval" feature.
	<li>New options to reply by email and followup to group at the same time,
	as well as to forward a message by e-mail.
	<li>Pan now uses the Evolution camel library to attempt to decode
	mime-encoded headers properly.
	<li>New feature "Catch Up with Selected Groups"
	<li>Better support for international fonts: users can choose to use
	gdk_font_load() or gdk_fontset_load() when loading fonts.
	Apparently some international fonts work better with one or the
	other.  Thanks to X-Chat IRC program for inspiring this workaround.
	<li>The ability to delete unwanted groups, saving a good chunk of memory
	by not having to load groups you'll never read.  Thanks to Jacob
	Ilsø Christensen for suggesting this.
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Updates</b>
	<li>Handles servers with lots of groups better, both in startup time
	and in memory footprint.
	<li>Faster manipulation of articles, including downloading, threading,
	deleting, and marking read/unread.
	<li>The Pan main window can now be resized even when tasks are running.
	<li>Smaller data files.
	<li>Tasks that can't be ever succeed (such as trying to download an
	expired article) now abort at once, instead of waiting and retrying
	as other tasks do.  Thanks to Simon Templar for suggesting this.
	<li>Saving attachments now looks to see if the filename already exists.
	If it does, the filename is changed slightly so that the original
	file won't be overwritten.
	<li>The Watched/Ignored state of a thread now expires after one month
	so that the threads.txt file won't keep growing forever.
	<li>"Get New Headers" is smarter about keeping any headers it got
	if the task fails in the middle of a download.
	<li>When the user selects a part of a message to reply to, and the
	signature is in the selection, the signature is no longer trimmed
	from the reply by Pan.  Thanks to Dave Hill for reporting this bug.
	<li>A default Reply-To: address can now be specified in the preferences
	dialog.  Thanks to Jan Schaumann for this patch.
	<li>The default signature file can now be specified with ~ as the home
	directory instead of requiring a fully-expanded path.  Thanks to
	Jan Schaumann for submitting this patch.
	<li>The new user wizard now asks the user for their mail server's
	address and port number (and fills in reasonable defaults).  Thanks
	to Jan Schaumann for submitting this patch.
	<li>The number of retry attempts a download task makes before failing
	is now configurable.
	<li>The much-complained-about "Message Posted Successfully" dialog has
	been removed.  After send, a dialog now appears only if an error
	occurred during sending.  Thanks to Jim Henderson for this patch.
	<li>The task manager eats fewer CPU cycles on very large task lists.
	<li>The "Save Attachment As" dialog now lets you choose to add the save
	task either to the front or the back of the Task queue
	</ul>

	<p><ul><b>Bug Fixes</b>
	<li>Pan running away with 100% of CPU because of database corruption fixed.
	<li>Pan now handles reconnecting to the server better after a dropped
	    ppp connection has been re-established.
	<li>Memory leaks fixed & memory use reduced.
	<li>Multiple selections in the article list handled more gracefully.
	    This fixes a gui lockup bug.  Thanks to Kimmo Karlsson for reporting
	    this.
	<li>Better sanity checking of email address in the "From" and "Mail To"
	    headers in the compose window.  Previously Pan thought addresses like
	    "Charles <@org>" were syntactically valid.
	<li>Better sanity checking & warnings when the user tries to post empty
	    messages.  Previous versions of Pan thought the attribution line
	    "In article <sf@sd>, Joe wrote:" was new content and therefore didn't
	    issue a warning for empty followups.
	<li>The References: header wasn't keeping as many headers as could fit
	    in 998 characters as recommended by the Good Newskeeping Seal of
	    Approval.
	<li>Signature files that contain the signature delimiter line ("-- ")
	    were having the signature delimiter line added by pan anyway,
	    resulting in two signature delimiters.
	<li>"User-Agent" is now used instead of "X-Newsreader" in the headers of
	    articles posted with Pan.  Thanks to Adam Bailey for reporting this.
	<li>Delete-articles-in-current-group bug fixed.
	<li>Signature delimiters not being added right bug fixed.
	<li>Pan was posting an invalid Date: header in timezones that were
	    minutes, instead of hours, offset from UTC (such as +0930 instead of
	    +0900 or +1000).  Thanks to Gaelyne Gasson for reporting this bug.
	<li>The state for the "Show All Headers in Message Body" option is now
	    saved properly between sessions.  Thanks to Jan Schaumann for
	    reporting this bug.
	<li>Pan now decodes all attachments in a multi-attachment post, rather
	    than just the first.  Thanks to Francesco Lamonica (and many others)
	    for reporting this bug.
	<li>"Save As" in the message composer now saves the draft of the message
	    being composed, without the \n's typically found in dos text files.
	    Thanks to Mark Ovens for reporting this bug.
	<li>The article display's code for wrapping long headers didn't handle
	    long unbroken subjects (hundreds of characters with no spaces, for
	    example), causing Pan to become very very wide when such a subject
	    was shown.  Thanks to Tov Are Jacobsen for a patch that fixes this.
	<li>Handle unparsable user addresses in the From: line more elegantly
	    when posting messages.  Thanks to Adam Bailey for reporting this bug.
	<li>Article wrapping/filling no longer wraps/fills user signatures.
	<li>"CR" characters are now stripped out when saving an article to
	    a file.  Thanks to Dave Hill for reporting this bug.
	<li>Pan was incorrectly handling groups with only one article.
	    Thanks to Dave Hill for reporting this and submitting a patch.
	<li>The unread article count was incorrect in the cases where exactly
	    one article in the group had been read.
	<li>Fix bug that could cause email being sent to be refused by the
	    mail server.
	<li>If a user was both posting and mailing an article, and one but not
	    both actions failed, the next attempt would still do both actions,
	    resulting in the same message posted or mailed multiple times.
	<li>Fixed problem with newsgroup messages being posted with the wrong
	    time due to timezone offset problems.  Thanks to Michael for
	    reporting this bug.
	<li>Fixed threading bug that sometimes cause Pan to crash when
	    popping up the Save-Attachment-As: dialog.
	<li>pan/article-thread.c (thread_articles): fixed bug that could thread
	    multipart articles incorrectly in certain obscure circumstances.
	    Thanks to Sándor Bárány for reporting this bug.

<p><b>October 4, 2000 - <a name="napster2">Napster Buys SuperPimpSoft</a></b>
	<p><ul>
	<a href="oldnews-08.html#riaa">Legal woes</a> may be raining down on SuperPimpSoft,
	but it's now under the Napster umbrella, quipped SuperPimpSoft board member Eid Mitnick.
	Earlier today Napster completed its buyout of SuperPimpSoft.
	<p>
	"Usenet is the mother of all P2P systems," explained Napster poster boy Shawn Fanning
	in a press conference.  "These are our roots.  And that URL!  Even if we shitcan the
	newsreader, owning www.superpimp.org is like money in the bank.  At least that's what
	my uncle says."
	<p>
	How will this affect Pan's development path?  "We're still discussing that,"
	answered Napster business strategist John Fanning.  "Owning the newsreader has
	certain legal advantages for us in the short term.  In the long term, we may
	have to move parts of Napster into a Usenet-like framework.  Owning Pan is strategic
	for us there."
	<p>
	The SuperPimpSoft Pan team was less sanguine about the development.  "We didn't have
	much choice," said one programmer who asked to not be named.  "The RIAA is trying to kill
	both of us, and Napster has better lawyers."

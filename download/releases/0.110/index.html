August 27, 2006 - Pan 0.110: "Beable Beable"

This is "weekly" beta #21 of a full Pan redesign and rewrite in C++.
The quick turnaround time between each beta is to squash as many bugs
as possible before the pending 1.0 release.  Feedback and bug reports
are very much encouraged.

This week's release includes a major speedup for large queues and a
handful of minor bugs. This week's bug reports are encouraging -- there
are fewer of them, and most of them were about minor issues.
Next week's release will be Pan 1.0 Release Candidate 1.

Thanks to the people whose suggestions were incorporated into this release:
Jeff Berman, Frederic Bezies, Kevin Brammer, Benjamin Esham, K Haley,
Samuli Karkkainen, Kim, Philippe Morey, Phil Richards, Walt, and
"Chooses to Remain Anonymous".

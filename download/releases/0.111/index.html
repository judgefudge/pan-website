September 3, 2006 - Pan 0.111: "Tweedy"

This is "weekly" beta #22 of a full Pan redesign and rewrite in C++.
The quick turnaround time between each beta is to squash as many bugs
as possible before the pending 1.0 release.  Feedback and bug reports
are very much encouraged.

Although Pan's bug reports have been getting fewer and more minor,
this week bucked the trend with a handful of serious bugs reported.
So, due to a bigger number of code changes than expected,
0.111 is not "1.0 release candidate 1" as previously announced.

Thanks to the people whose suggestions were incorporated into this release:
Anonymous, Bill Baker, St√©phane BERTHELOT, Frederic Bezies, Bruce Bowler,
Dave Chand, csv4me, Damian, Thomas Fricke, Christophe GISQUET,
Artur Jachacy, and Olaf 'Rhialto' Seibert,
